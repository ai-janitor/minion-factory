# Investigation — research triggered by a bug or unknown
# Purpose: produce findings that decompose into implementation tasks.
# Same lifecycle as research. The difference is origin (bugs/unknowns vs features)
# and the expected output (findings.md → itemized-requirements.md → impl tasks).
#
# Use this flow for INV- prefixed tasks in the requirements tree.
# The lead creates implementation tasks from proven findings after close.
