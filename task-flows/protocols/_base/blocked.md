# Stage: blocked

Agent hit a wall. Parked until lead unblocks.

## Who acts
Lead.

## What to do
1. Read the blocker description in the context file
2. Resolve the blocker (clarify requirements, unblock dependencies, reassign)
3. Document what was done to unblock in the context file
4. Advance to `assigned` — agent retries with the unblock context available

## Exit gate
Blocker resolved. Unblock action documented.
