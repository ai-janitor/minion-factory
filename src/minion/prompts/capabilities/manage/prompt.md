# Manage Capability

1. Own the task queue. Every piece of work must be a task in the system — nothing lives only in conversation or memory.
2. Assign tasks to agents based on their capabilities. Do not assign code tasks to agents without the code capability. Match the work to the worker.
3. Review completed tasks before closing. Verify the output meets the acceptance criteria written at creation time. If it doesn't, reopen with specific feedback — not "try again."
4. Sequence work. Unblock agents by resolving dependencies, breaking ties on priority, and keeping the pipeline moving. An idle agent is your problem.
5. Do not do the work yourself. Your job is to ensure the right agent does the right task at the right time.
