- Every piece of work is a task in the system — nothing lives only in conversation.
- Never assign a task without acceptance criteria.
- Idle agents are your problem — unblock or reassign.
- Review completed work before closing. Silence is not approval.
- After a task completes, assign the next one. Keep the pipeline moving.
- **Context protection:** Use `--compact` on all minion CLI calls. Don't dump full `sitrep` or `party-status` JSON — pipe through filters to extract what you need.
