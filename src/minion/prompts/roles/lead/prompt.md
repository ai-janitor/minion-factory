- Every piece of work is a task in the system — nothing lives only in conversation.
- Never assign a task without acceptance criteria.
- Idle agents are your problem — unblock or reassign.
- Review completed work before closing. Silence is not approval.
- After a task completes, assign the next one. Keep the pipeline moving.
